# FB-Friend-Recommendation

Facebook features people as people you may know through connections on your profile like mutual friends, work or education information, networks, etc. For example: If both of you add the same college in your education then you both will be shown on people you may know on each otherâ€™s profile. Or if both of you have a large number of mutual friends then Facebook guesses that you people might know each other. And so the recommendation follows.

Given a directed social graph, we have to predict missing links to recommend users (Link Prediction in graph)
